# sleepy.py

Fully open-source discord bot coded in python using discord.py recode.

## Usage

Make sure to install all the dependencies, they're in `install.txt`. Then make a file called `cfg.yaml`. and add this:

```yaml
# Config file for private stuff like discord's token, api tokens etc...
# This file wont be uploaded to github so you're safe my friend.
Bot:
  Token: token # Change this for the token
```

This file will contain all your personal information and it won't be uploaded to GitHub.
